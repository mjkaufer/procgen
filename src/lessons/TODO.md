Some ideas todo eventually
* Mesh that can be "chiseled from a block" on mouse hover
  * Created through a bounding rect that we map to points in geometry or smthng
  * Chiseled pieces explode outwards w/ trajectory, such that the V0 is equal to the normal of the underlying model
* Boat w/ dynamic waves
  * Use boat position & velocity in vertex shader to influence wave position
* More effect ideas
  * Colorized ASCII shader (right now just have barebones one, could make better one w/ HSL basis, using "H" as row in texture)
  * VHS texture
  * Pattern based cross-fade texture
* Experiment w/ combining DOM / text on webpage into 3D
  * Maybe optical illusion where it looks like 2D text, but is actually 3D, and then stuff happens
    * i.e. on hover creates a blue bounding rect
